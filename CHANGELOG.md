# Changelog

All notable changes to `nish` are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

**This file is generated.** A section is written when a release is cut, from
the commits that release contains: `scripts/changelog-gen.mjs` reads each
commit's subject for the heading and its body for the prose, and writes
`changelog/<version>.json`. That JSON is the record — it is what the website
reads — and the section below is rendered from it. To fix a wording, edit the
JSON in the release pull request and re-render; editing here is overwritten.

A section is an index rather than an account: one line per change, its title
and a link to the pull request it landed in, under the heading its type gives.
The prose each commit wrote is in the JSON and on the website, and the pull
request has the diff and the discussion, so a reader scanning a release sees
what changed and one click to the rest.

The release pull request is where a release is reviewed: every merge to `main`
refreshes it with the version bump, the JSON and this section, and merging it
creates the tag. [docs/wp12-release.md](docs/wp12-release.md) has the
procedure, and `CLAUDE.md` has the commit convention the headings come from.
Between releases `[Unreleased]` is empty, because there is nothing to write by
hand — the git log is the working account until a release turns it into one.
